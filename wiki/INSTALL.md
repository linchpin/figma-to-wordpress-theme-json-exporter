## Setting Up Your Figma Document

For the best results when using the WordPress Theme.json Exporter:

### Variable Collections

1. **Create a "Primitives" collection** - This collection will be used as the base for your theme.json file.
2. **Organize your variables in a hierarchical structure** - Use the slash (/) separator to create hierarchy in variable names (e.g., "color/primary/900").
3. **For responsive variables** - Create a collection with exactly two modes named "Desktop" and "Mobile".
4. **For color modes** - Create a "Color" collection with different modes for each color scheme.
5. **For spacing variables** - Create a "Spacing" collection or include spacing variables in your "Primitives" collection.

### Text Styles

1. **Create text styles for your typography** - These will be exported as typography presets.
2. **Use meaningful names** - Name your text styles descriptively (e.g., "Heading/H1", "Body/Regular").
3. **Bind text properties to variables when possible** - The plugin will use variable references for bound properties.

### Color Variables

1. **Organize color variables** - Group related colors using hierarchical naming (e.g., "color/primary", "color/secondary").
2. **Use semantic naming** - Name colors by their purpose rather than their appearance (e.g., "primary" instead of "blue").
3. **Create color modes** - Use multiple modes in your Color collection for different themes (light/dark).

### Spacing Variables

1. **Use descriptive naming** - Include keywords like "spacing", "gap", "margin", "padding", or "size".
2. **Create fluid spacing** - Use the pattern `MAX_MIN` (e.g., `24_16`) for responsive spacing values.
3. **Organize hierarchically** - Use forward slashes to create spacing scales (e.g., "spacing/small", "spacing/large").

## Exporting to theme.json

1. Open your Figma document with variables and text styles
2. Go to Menu > Plugins > WordPress Theme.json Export > Export to theme.json
3. In the plugin UI, you can:
   - Choose to include typography presets (from text styles)
   - Generate color presets with customizable selection (If adding/editing variables, you may need to close and reopen the plugin if color variables are msising)
   - Generate spacing presets from spacing variables
   - Upload an existing theme.json file to merge variables into it
   - Preview the generated theme.json and additional style files
   - Download all files as a zip package

### WordPress Integration

The generated files provide:

- **Custom variables** under `settings.custom` for use in CSS
- **Typography presets** available in the block editor's typography controls

## Features

### Typography Presets

The plugin automatically creates typography presets from your Figma text styles, with:
- Font family, size, weight, and line height properties
- Line height values converted from percentages (120%) to decimals (1.2)
- Proper text decoration handling for color, style, thickness, and offset

### Fluid Variables

For responsive variables (using Desktop and Mobile modes):
- Values are exported as fluid variables with min and max values
- The `fluid` property is set as `"true"` (string) for WordPress compatibility

### Color Modes

For color collections with multiple modes:
- Each mode is exported as a separate section file
- Files can be used for WordPress theme variations or block styles

### Button Variations

Button styles in your color collection are automatically:
- Extracted into separate style files
- Formatted for use as WordPress block styles

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Variables not exporting** - Make sure your variables are published and visible in the Variables panel.
2. **Text styles not appearing** - Check that your text styles are local to the document.
3. **Missing typography properties** - Some properties may be omitted if they contain invalid values.
4. **Base theme not loading** - Ensure your theme.json file is valid JSON and follows the WordPress theme.json schema.
