# Figma to WordPress theme.json Exporter

This is a pretty major fork of the original 10up plugin. It is highly opinionated to the approach Linchpin takes to components being exported for our design systems and client websites

The original 10up plugin may be a great base for your project or you can run with this one, however the baseline 10up one is more table and we have breaking changes
in this experimental approach

## WordPress theme.json Structure

The plugin generates a valid WordPress theme.json file with all variables placed under the `settings.custom` section:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "settings": {
    "custom": {
      "color": {
        "primary": "#000000",
        "secondary": "#ffffff",
        "accent": "var(--wp--custom--color--primary)",
        "button": {
          "default": {
            "background": "var(--wp--custom--color--button--primary--default--background)",
            "text": "var(--wp--custom--color--button--primary--default--text)"
          },
          "hover": {
            "background": "var(--wp--custom--color--button--primary--hover--background)",
            "text": "var(--wp--custom--color--button--primary--hover--text)"
          }
        }
      },
      "spacing": {
        "base": "8px",
        "large": "24px"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Base Theme Merging

When uploading an existing theme.json file:
- The plugin preserves all existing theme settings and styles
- New variables from Figma are merged into the `settings.custom` section
- Existing custom variables with the same name are updated with new values
- Other sections of the theme.json file remain untouched
- Color modes and button styles are still exported as separate files

### Collection Processing Architecture

The plugin uses a sophisticated processor-based architecture to handle different types of Figma variable collections. Each collection is processed by a specific processor based on its name and structure, ensuring optimal handling for different use cases.

### Processor System

The plugin employs a list of processors that are evaluated in sequence:

1. **Primitives Processor** - Handles the "Primitives" collection as the base theme
2. **WordPress Settings Colors Processor** - Processes color collections for palette generation
3. **WordPress Settings Subset Processor** - Handles layout, spacing, typography, and shadow collections
4. **WordPress Settings Processor** - Processes general WordPress settings collections
5. **WordPress Elements Processor** - Handles element-specific "block" collections (buttons, headings, etc.)
6. **Fallback Selected Processor** - Catches any remaining collections and adds them to custom settings

### Collection Types and Processing

#### Primitives Collection

Variables from a collection named "Primitives" are used as the base theme and are always processed first:
- Merged directly into `settings.custom` without a namespace
- Serves as the foundation for all other custom variables
- Always processed first in the processor chain

#### WordPress Settings Collections

Collections following the `wp.settings.*` naming convention are processed according to their specific type:

**Color Collections (`wp.settings.color`)**
- Intentionally NOT merged into `settings.custom`
- Colors are surfaced via palette presets instead of custom variables
- Button styles are extracted and processed separately

**Subset Collections (`wp.settings.layout`, `wp.settings.spacing`, `wp.settings.typography`, `wp.settings.shadow`)**
- Merged directly into the corresponding WordPress settings section
- Example: `wp.settings.spacing` variables go into `settings.spacing`
- Supports deep merging with existing settings

**General Settings Collections (`wp.settings`)**
- Known WordPress settings keys are merged into the appropriate sections
- Unknown keys are placed under `settings.custom`
- Supports both exact matches and nested paths

#### WordPress Elements Collections

Collections following the `wp.elements.*` naming convention:
- Processed into `styles.elements` structure
- Special handling for button elements with automatic style file generation
- Supports nested element paths (e.g., `wp.elements.buttons` → `styles.elements.button`)

#### Fallback Processing

Any collection not matched by specific processors:
- Automatically added to `settings.custom` with sanitized naming
- Color-related properties are filtered out to prevent conflicts
- Ensures all variables are captured regardless of naming conventions

### Processing Order and Priority

The processor system ensures that:
- More specific processors run before general ones
- WordPress-specific collections are handled appropriately
- All collections are processed regardless of naming conventions
- No variables are lost during the export process

This architecture provides flexibility for different design system approaches while maintaining compatibility with WordPress theme.json standards.

### Legacy Collection Handling

For backward compatibility, the plugin also provides special handling for certain legacy collection names:

#### Color Collection with Multiple Modes

If a collection named "Color" has multiple modes:
- The first mode is merged into the main theme.json
- Each mode (including the first) is also exported as a separate file: `styles/section-{mode-name}.json`
- These files include proper metadata for WordPress theme variations

#### Button Styles

When the "Color" collection includes a "button" group with variants:
- Button variant properties from the primary button are referenced at the root level with CSS variables
- Each non-primary button variant (e.g., secondary, tertiary, etc.) is exported as a separate file: `styles/button-{variant-name}.json`
- These files include proper metadata for WordPress block style variations

### Typography Handling

The plugin can generate typography presets from Figma text styles:

- Font family, size, weight, and line height are extracted from text styles
- Line height values in percentage format (120%) are automatically converted to decimal format (1.2) as required by WordPress
- Text decoration properties (color, style, thickness, offset) are properly handled
- The plugin omits empty or invalid properties rather than using fallbacks to ensure clean output

### Responsive/Fluid Variables

If a collection has exactly two modes named "Desktop" and "Mobile", the plugin treats them as responsive variables:

```json
{
  "spacing": {
    "base": {
      "fluid": "true",
      "min": "8px",
      "max": "16px"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The "fluid" property is output as a string value "true" rather than a boolean to ensure compatibility with WordPress theme.json parsing.

### Units Handling

The plugin automatically adds "px" units to numeric values in appropriate categories:
- spacing
- font
- size
- grid
- radius
- width
- height

### CSS Custom Properties

The plugin automatically converts references between variables to WordPress CSS custom property format. According to WordPress conventions:

- All custom properties are prefixed with `--wp--custom--`
- Each level of nesting adds another `--` separator
- CamelCase names are converted to kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)

For example:
```
settings.custom.colorPalette.brandAccent → var(--wp--custom--color-palette--brand-accent)
```

This ensures that your theme.json file follows WordPress best practices and that all variable references will work correctly in your theme.

For more information on the WordPress theme.json format, see the [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/global-settings-and-styles/).

## Color Presets

The plugin can generate WordPress color presets from your Figma color variables, making them available in the WordPress block editor's color picker. For comprehensive information about this feature, see [COLOR-PRESETS-GUIDE.md](COLOR-PRESETS-GUIDE.md).

### Quick Overview

- Processes color variables from all collections except "Primitives"
- Customizable selection through an interactive modal interface
- Organized by collection with visual color previews
- Creates WordPress color presets under `settings.color.palette`

## Spacing Presets

The plugin automatically generates WordPress spacing presets from Figma spacing variables. For detailed information about spacing presets, see [SPACING-GUIDE.md](SPACING-GUIDE.md).

### Quick Overview

- Processes variables from "Spacing" and "Primitives" collections
- Automatically detects spacing-related keywords (spacing, gap, margin, padding, size)
- Special handling for fluid spacing variables (e.g., `24_16` becomes "Fluid (16 → 24)")
- Creates WordPress spacing presets under `settings.spacing.spacingSizes`

## Output Files

The plugin generates several types of files depending on your configuration and Figma setup:

### Core Files

1. **Main theme.json**
   - Contains the base theme settings from the "Primitives" collection
   - Includes the first mode of the "Color" collection
   - Contains all custom variables under `settings.custom`
   - Includes typography, color, and spacing presets if enabled

### Style Variation Files

2. **Section Files** (when applicable)
   - Located in the "styles" directory
   - File naming: `section-{mode-name}.json`
   - Generated for Color collections with multiple modes
   - Each file represents a color mode that can be applied to groups or sections
   - Includes proper WordPress theme variation metadata

3. **Button Style Files** (when applicable)
   - Located in the "styles" directory
   - File naming: `button-{variant-name}.json`
   - Generated when button variants are found in the Color collection
   - Each file represents a button style variant for WordPress block styles
   - Includes proper WordPress block style variation metadata

### File Generation Logic

- **Single file**: When only basic variables are exported without additional modes or button variants
- **Multiple files**: When Color collections have multiple modes or button variants are detected
- **Automatic zip packaging**: When multiple files are generated, they're automatically packaged into a zip file for download

### File Structure Example

For a complex setup, you might get:
```
wordpress-theme-files.zip
├── theme.json                    # Main theme file
└── styles/
    ├── section-light.json        # Light color mode
    ├── section-dark.json         # Dark color mode
    ├── button-secondary.json     # Secondary button variant
    └── button-tertiary.json      # Tertiary button variant
```

All files are packed into a single zip download for easy use in WordPress themes.
